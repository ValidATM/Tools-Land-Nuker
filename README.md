# Tools-Land-Nuker
A really good nuker I have created and decided to make open source, it is the same nuker which was used on [boostility](boostility.org) ðŸ’”

# Steps to use it.
   â”€â”€â”€> Install [Python](https://python.org])
    â”€â”€â”€> Install all the requirements by running install_requirements.bat.
     â”€â”€â”€> Go into config.json and where it says token put **your discord bot token**
      â”€â”€â”€> It will also ask for channel names spam message etc. You can customize it.


When you have done all those steps you can go into the server the bot is in and run .kill :fire:
